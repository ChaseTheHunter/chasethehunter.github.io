*My contribution to the CBMC in 2015*

About | Role | Time |
------------ | -------------| -------- |----|
20 pages Comic + 1 Cover, needed to involve their logo | **Participant** | 2 Weeks |

The Crazy Bat Manga Challenge by *Martina Peters, Reyhan, Daniela Winkler, Melanie Schober and Olga Rogalski* is a Contest in which each participant has to draw a 20-paged *(+1 optional Cover)* manga or comic which includes their logo. 2 Weeks before the contest was over I got to know it and decided to participate. To challenge myself I decided to make everything in full color. For the story I got inspired by the song "Louder than Thunder - The Devil wears Prada".
