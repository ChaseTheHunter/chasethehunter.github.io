*Have a look at my Illustrations for the Best Artist 2014 - 2015*

6 Illustrations based on given themes | **Participant** | - |

The Best Artist Contest has several rounds, in each you get rated and pass onto the next round or not. For each round you get themes and rules you have follow. In 2014 were ~85 participants and 6 rounds which I all passed and got to 2nd place. This was more of an opportunity to get used to draw backgrounds, to get in touch with new people and share experience rather than only the means of a contest. Nethertheless it was a great participating, that's why I joined for Best Artist 2017 again.
