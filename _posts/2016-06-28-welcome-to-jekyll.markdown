The environment and enemies represent Riley’s state of denial the illness Lou suffers from, therefore we go through different stages of the illness. Starting off with with a fantasy theme and the symptoms fatigue, powerlessness and melancholy. 

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
