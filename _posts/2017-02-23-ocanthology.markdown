*Have a look at some of my private projects, collaborations and contests.*


## **OC-Anthology Artbook 2015-2016**

About | Role | Time |
------------ | -------------| -------- |----|
Non-profit collaborative artist project | **Organisation, Administration, Design, Illustration** | 10 months |

It's an 114-paged Artbook about the different OCs *(Original Characters)* from ~50 Artist around Germany and Japan. Jenny 'TheJenno' Michler and I took care of the organisation and administration of this project, as well as the communication with the different artists. We also contributed to the project as artists. The project itself can be divided in different terms: Planning-Phase, Application-Phase for the Artists, Drawing-Phase and Post-Phase.
