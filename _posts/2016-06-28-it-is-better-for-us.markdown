3D Animated Short | **2D Artist, Animator** | Environment Concepts, 2D Assets, 3D Animation | 1/2 Semester |


The Environment has a subtle color transition, warm colors for the seemingly happy moments and cold colors for the triste ones. It includes the life of the couple, but in a reduced way, due to the many changes of the backgrounds throughout the short. 
This project was my first attemp in 3D Animation. We had 3 weeks of animation time, which was tough, but a great experience on how to deal with the scope of a project under great pressure. 
*(Note to "Time":joined the team in the second half of the semester)*
