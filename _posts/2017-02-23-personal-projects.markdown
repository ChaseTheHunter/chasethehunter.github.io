#**OC-Anthology Artbook 2015-2016**#

About | Role | Time |
------------ | -------------| -------- |----|
Non-profit collaborative artist project | **Organisation, Administration, Design, Illustration** | 10 months |

It's an 114-paged Artbook about the different OCs *(Original Characters)* from ~50 Artist around Germany and Japan. Jenny 'TheJenno' Michler and I took care of the organisation and administration of this project, as well as the communication with the different artists. We also contributed to the project as artists. The project itself can be divided in different terms: Planning-Phase, Application-Phase for the Artists, Drawing-Phase and Post-Phase.

#**Best Artist 2014 (-2015)**#

About | Role | Time |
------------ | -------------| -------- |----|
6 Illustrations based on given themes | **Participant** | *including concept, sketch, lineart, coloration & postproduction* |

The Best Artist Contest has several rounds, in each you get rated and pass onto the next round or not. For each round you get themes and rules you have follow. In 2014 were ~85 participants and 6 rounds which I all passed and got to 2nd place. This was more of an opportunity to get used to draw backgrounds, to get in touch with new people and share experience rather than only the means of a contest. Nethertheless it was a great participating, that's why I joined for Best Artist 2017 again.

#**Crazy Bat Manga Challenge 2015**#

About | Role | Time |
------------ | -------------| -------- |----|
20 pages Comic + 1 Cover, needed to involve their logo | **Participant** | 2 Weeks |

The Crazy Bat Manga Challenge by *Martina Peters, Reyhan, Daniela Winkler, Melanie Schober and Olga Rogalski* is a Contest in which each participant has to draw a 20-paged *(+1 optional Cover)* manga or comic which includes their logo. 2 Weeks before the contest was over I got to know it and decided to participate. To challenge myself I decided to make everything in full color. For the story I got inspired by the song "Louder than Thunder - The Devil wears Prada".
