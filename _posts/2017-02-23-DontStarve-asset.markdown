**Light my way, little faery light<br>**

The mod contains a lantern in the Don't Starve style. It's called "Morgentau", which translates to morning dew. It's designed after the magical essence of a fairy village light source, hence Don't Starve crosses the fairy path severel times in the game. 
The asset is listed in the fire-section and needs an Alchemy Engine to craft. It seamlessly listed just like every other asset in the game. Also the normal crafting list is displayed, when hovering over the icon. When standing within the radius of the light, the character gains sanity (unless it looses sanity, when standing within light in general). 
**The asset is animated in Spriter and the Code is written in Lua.**
