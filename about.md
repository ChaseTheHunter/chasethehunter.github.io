#**About me**#
I'm Chase, 21 years young and currently studying Animation and Game at the [h_da](https://www.h-da.de/studium/studienangebot/studiengaenge/architektur-medien-und-design/animation-game-ba/). I'm an [ISTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/istj-personality) which means I'm a sucker for work and this all honor n stuff. Oh oh! And routine, dear maker, I loooove routine! Optimizing the work to its most efficient peak, which means doing the best that I can while binge-watching the heck out of so many series... I'd love to say that I'm *just kidding*. Anyway besides dedicating my soul to being productive, I'm just as shy as a rabbit and a 160cm tall living beeing full of insecurities. But HEY, who isn't? Guess that's just what makes us humans after all.  

You *may* not have noticed, but I'm really into all this nerdstuff. Y'know like Comics, Anime, RPG, Video-Game typ'a things. But just using what's out there isn't enough for me, I wanna contribute to this world of special snowflakes as well! This is my passion, my goal and everyday I'm getting a step closer.
